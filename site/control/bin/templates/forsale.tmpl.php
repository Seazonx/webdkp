WebDKP is now available for sale! This includes the domain name and entire service.
If you are interested in purchasing WebDKP or would like to find out more,
please contact me at <a href="mailto:scott@zeddic.com">scott@zeddic.com</a>. I will
provide full revenue information to interested parties. I will say that WebDKP
is very profitable, with over a 60% profit margin.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Why?</h2>
Due to work obligations  I am running very short of time.
As a result, I am no longer able to give WebDKP as much attention
as it deserves. This is unfair to the community that uses WebDKP. To solve this,
I wish to sell the  WebDKP service to someone else who can give
it attention. This is my loss, but someone else's gain.
<br />
<br />
<h2>About WebDKP</h2>
WebDKP is both very profitable and <a href="#stats">continuing to grow</a>. It has over <b>14,000</b>
subscribed guilds and over <b>500,000</b> users. On average it has <b>10 Million</b>
hits per month with over <b>100,000</b> unique visitors.
<br />
<br />
WebDKP generates income through a combination of advertisements and paid subscribers.
Advertisements are provided through Google's Adsense service.
Guilds can subscribe to disable advertisements. There are currently over 100 subscribed
guilds.
<br />
<br />

<h2>What is For Sale?</h2>
I am selling the entire website and service. This includes the WebDKP.com domain
name, database, and software. This software is built to support many guilds
simultaneously and works very efficiently. The software is well designed
with all code highly documented. It is constructed on the TextSide framework, which I have
<a href="http://www.textside.com">fully documented</a>. This makes it easy for
any other developer to pick up WebDKP source and add more features to it.
<br />
<br />
I am <b>not</b> selling the physical server that WebDKP is running on,
but will assist the buyer  in setting up WebDKP on their server and switching the
domain name to that server. I will also transfer the domain name to their ownership.
I currently rent a dedicated server to host WebDKP, and would recommend the
buyer to do the same.
The WebDKP service will not run on $5 per month shared hosting.
<br />
<br />
